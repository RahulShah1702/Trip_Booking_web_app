My Approach to the Assignment
This project was developed using a modern, component-based approach to fulfill the assignment requirements.


Core Technology: The application is built using React.js with Vite as the build tool.  React was chosen for its powerful component model and state management capabilities, which are ideal for building interactive UIs. Vite was selected for its fast development server and optimized build process.


Component-Based Architecture: I structured the application into modular and reusable components as required. 

Page Components (HomePage, SearchResultsPage, CheckoutPage, etc.) act as containers for different views of the application.

UI Components (Navbar, TripCard, FilterPanel, etc.) are smaller, reusable pieces that are assembled to build the pages. This approach makes the code easier to manage, debug, and scale.


State Management: React Hooks were used for all state management to create a dynamic and interactive experience. 


useState: This hook was used to manage local component state, such as the values of the form inputs on the CheckoutPage and the active filter criteria on the 

SearchResultsPage. 


useEffect: This hook was used to handle side effects, most notably to re-apply the trip filters whenever a user changes a filter criterion, thus updating the search results in real-time. 

Routing: React Router DOM was implemented to handle client-side navigation. This provides a seamless, single-page application experience without full page reloads. The router was configured with both static routes (e.g., /search) and dynamic routes (e.g., /trip/:id) to efficiently display unique detail pages for each trip.


Data Handling: As specified, the application fetches all trip data from a static trips.json file.  This file is directly imported into the relevant components, simplifying data access without the need for an external API call.


UI/UX and Styling: The focus was on creating a clean, engaging, and easy-to-use interface. 

Styling: I used component-specific CSS files to keep styles modular and avoid conflicts. Global styles for the theme (colors, fonts) were defined in index.css.


Responsiveness: CSS Flexbox and Grid were used to create a fluid layout that adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes, meeting the responsive design requirement.
